STEPS FOR BUILDING A BIOCAT RELEASE

August 16, 2012

0. Decide a release number.  Update the release number in: AnnMenuBar.java  displayAbout()
                                     AnnotatorGUI.java main()

1.  Generate biocat.jar 
    In Eclipse, "export...", 
	choose: executable jar file;  put the needed libaraies next to the jar
	
    a. The needed external libraries should be up-to-date, in particular, ij.jar (for ImageJ) should be correct: Image version 145.
    b. The jdk should be 1.6 instead of 1.7 for version compatibility

2.  Clean up biocat.jar
    In 7zip:  remove unneeded folders such as ROI_annotatotor, mRMR, and cell_counting
    (Can I not include them in Step 1?)


3. Create the tar file:
   Add:  
         1. Algorithms.xml  -- Make sure it is up-to-date.
         2. Sample image folder with k150, 2DROI (etc.)
         3. run
	 4. ReleaseNotes.txt
         5. Terms and Conditions.txt
         6. Readme file
         Optional:
         1. biocat.exe for windows
         2. 2 libraraies files for mRMR
