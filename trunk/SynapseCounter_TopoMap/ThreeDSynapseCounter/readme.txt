this folder is for materials related to Three Dimensional Synapse Quantification
including:
	-annotator code
	-imageJ plugin elements
	-test data sets
	

      It will be the home of the following:
	   1. The class out of the biocat  "3DROIAnnotator", which takes images and output marker file. It can run by itself in command line (using ij.jar, biocat.jar)
	   2. The ImageJ plugin GUI: Jon's driver that calls the 3DROI Annotator (takes images, chain files .. and output marker file).
	   3. The ImageJ plugin for 3D connected component analysis and splitting (Object_Counter3D_2Channel.java)  -- It is the one that outputs synapse count and other statistics.
	   4. Other related datasets
