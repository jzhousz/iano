Basic Steps for Building a BIOCAT release
   2/26/2016

1. Build an executable jar file using Eclipse.
     biocat.jar  - It should have the images folder, and not the src folder.
2. Clean up the biocat.jar file to remove:
  a. src folder if it is there.
  b. unrelated projects if there are any (e.g. cell_counting, mRMR).
  c. the library if there are any
  (Note: If we use maven or ant later, then the cleanup step can be avoided.)    
3. Update ReleaseNotes.txt.  
   Check in the ReleaseNotes.txt.
   (Optional: update readme.txt if needed.). 
4. Create a folder BIOCAT-mmddyyyy-multi, with all other resources to be built. Total 9 items.
    - biocat.jar
	- BioCAT_lib
	- Sample Image Sets
	- plugins folder of 3rd party algorithms.
	- Algorithms.xml  (the newest one that you checked out)
	- Readme.txt
	- ReleaseNotes.txt
	- Terms and Conditions.txt
	- run.bat (for windows)
	- run.sh  (for Unix/Mac)
5. run biocat using the example set problem using a basic extractor and classifier to validate the release.
6. Zip the folder. The zip file is: BIOCAT-mmddyyyy-multi.zip
